  <h1>Lauren Kuhlman</h1>
  <p></p>
  <p>
    I was born and raised in Ohio. I lived in Chicago, Tahoe and traveled as a digital nomad for 3 years. I love the
    outdoors and I spend as much time as I can hiking, camping, and paddleboarding. I also enjoy exploring new places
    and trying new things.
  </p>

  <p>I am passionate about web development and I am excited to start my career in this field. I am a hard worker and I
    am always willing to learn new things. I am also a creative thinker and I am always looking for new ways to solve
    problems. I am a team player and I am always willing to help others.</p>
